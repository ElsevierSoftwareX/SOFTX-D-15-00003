          [-rot0 <real>] [-T <string>] [-[no]nn]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgmx wheel\fR plots a helical wheel representation of your sequence. The input sequence is in the \fB.dat\fR file where the first line contains the number of residues and each consecutive line contains a residue name.

.SH OPTIONS
Options to specify input and output files:

.BI "\-f" " [<.dat>] (nnnice.dat) (Input)"
    Generic data file

.BI "\-o" " [<.eps>] (plot.eps) (Output)"
    Encapsulated PostScript (tm) file


Other options:

.BI "\-nice" " <int> (19)"
    Set the nicelevel

.BI "\-r0" " <int> (1)"
    The first residue number in the sequence

.BI "\-rot0" " <real> (0)"
    Rotate around an angle initially (90 degrees makes sense)

.BI "\-T" " <string>"
    Plot a title in the center of the wheel (must be shorter than 10 characters, or it will overwrite the wheel)
