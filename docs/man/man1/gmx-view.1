.SH NAME
gmx-view - View a trajectory on an X-Windows terminal

.SH SYNOPSIS
gmx view [-f [<.xtc/.trr/...>]] [-s [<.tpr/.tpb/...>]] [-n [<.ndx>]]
         [-nice <int>] [-b <time>] [-e <time>] [-dt <time>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgmx view\fR is the GROMACS trajectory viewer. This program reads a trajectory file, a run input file and an index file and plots a 3D structure of your molecule on your standard X Window screen. No need for a high end graphics workstation, it even works on Monochrome screens.

The following features have been implemented: 3D view, rotation, translation and scaling of your molecule(s), labels on atoms, animation of trajectories, hardcopy in PostScript format, user defined atom\-filters runs on MIT\-X (real X), open windows and motif, user friendly menus, option to remove periodicity, option to show computational box.

Some of the more common X command line options can be used: \fB\-bg\fR, \fB\-fg\fR change colors, \fB\-font fontname\fR changes the font.

.SH OPTIONS
Options to specify input and output files:

.BI "\-f" " [<.xtc/.trr/...>] (traj.xtc) (Input)"
    Trajectory: xtc trr cpt trj gro g96 pdb tng

.BI "\-s" " [<.tpr/.tpb/...>] (topol.tpr) (Input)"
    Run input file: tpr tpb tpa

.BI "\-n" " [<.ndx>] (index.ndx) (Input, Optional)"
    Index file


Other options:

.BI "\-nice" " <int> (0)"
    Set the nicelevel

.BI "\-b" " <time> (0)"
    First frame (ps) to read from trajectory

.BI "\-e" " <time> (0)"
    Last frame (ps) to read from trajectory

.BI "\-dt" " <time> (0)"
    Only use frame when t MOD dt = first time (ps)


.SH KNOWN ISSUES


\- Balls option does not work

\- Some times dumps core without a good reason
