.SH NAME
gmx-h2order - Compute the orientation of water molecules

.SH SYNOPSIS
gmx h2order [-f [<.xtc/.trr/...>]] [-n [<.ndx>]] [-nm [<.ndx>]]
            [-s [<.tpr/.tpb/...>]] [-o [<.xvg>]] [-nice <int>]
            [-b <time>] [-e <time>] [-dt <time>] [-[no]w]
            [-xvg <enum>] [-d <string>] [-sl <int>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgmx h2order\fR computes the orientation of water molecules with respect to the normal of the box. The program determines the average cosine of the angle between the dipole moment of water and an axis of the box. The box is divided in slices and the average orientation per slice is printed. Each water molecule is assigned to a slice, per time frame, based on the position of the oxygen. When \fB\-nm\fR is used, the angle between the water dipole and the axis from the center of mass to the oxygen is calculated instead of the angle between the dipole and a box axis.

.BI "\-sl" " <int> (0)"
    Calculate order parameter as function of boxlength, dividing the box in this number of slices.


.SH KNOWN ISSUES


\- The program assigns whole water molecules to a slice, based on the first atom of three in the index file group. It assumes an order O,H,H. Name is not important, but the order is. If this demand is not met, assigning molecules to slices is different.
