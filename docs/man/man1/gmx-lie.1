.SH NAME
gmx-lie - Estimate free energy from linear combinations

.SH SYNOPSIS
gmx lie [-f [<.edr>]] [-o [<.xvg>]] [-nice <int>] [-b <time>]
        [-e <time>] [-dt <time>] [-[no]w] [-xvg <enum>] [-Elj <real>]
        [-Eqq <real>] [-Clj <real>] [-Cqq <real>] [-ligand <string>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgmx lie\fR computes a free energy estimate based on an energy analysis from nonbonded energies. One needs an energy file with the following components: Coul\-(A\-B) LJ\-SR (A\-B) etc.

To utilize \fBg_lie\fR correctly, two simulations are required: one with the molecule of interest bound to its receptor and one with the molecule in water. Both need to utilize \fBenergygrps\fR such that Coul\-SR(A\-B), LJ\-SR(A\-B), etc. terms are written to the \fB.edr\fR file. Values from the molecule\-in\-water simulation are necessary for supplying suitable values for \-Elj and \-Eqq.
