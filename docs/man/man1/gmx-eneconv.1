.SH NAME
gmx-eneconv - Convert energy files

.SH SYNOPSIS
gmx eneconv [-f [<.edr> [...]]] [-o [<.edr>]] [-nice <int>]
            [-b <real>] [-e <real>] [-dt <real>] [-offset <real>]
            [-[no]settime] [-[no]sort] [-[no]rmdh] [-scalefac <real>]
            [-[no]error]

.SH DESCRIPTION
With \fImultiple files\fR specified for the \fB\-f\fR option:
Concatenates several energy files in sorted order. In the case of double time frames, the one in the later file is used. By specifying \fB\-settime\fR you will be asked for the start time of each file. The input files are taken from the command line, such that the command \fBgmx eneconv \-f *.edr \-o fixed.edr\fR should do the trick.

With \fIone file\fR specified for \fB\-f\fR:
Reads one energy file and writes another, applying the \fB\-dt\fR, \fB\-offset\fR, \fB\-t0\fR and \fB\-settime\fR options and converting to a different format if necessary (indicated by file extentions).

\fB\-settime\fR is applied first, then \fB\-dt\fR/\fB\-offset\fR followed by \fB\-b\fR and \fB\-e\fR to select which frames to write.

.SH OPTIONS
Options to specify input and output files:

.BI "\-f" " [<.edr> [...]] (ener.edr) (Input)"
    Energy file

.BI "\-o" " [<.edr>] (fixed.edr) (Output)"
    Energy file


Other options:

.BI "\-nice" " <int> (19)"
    Set the nicelevel

.BI "\-b" " <real> (-1)"
    First time to use

.BI "\-e" " <real> (-1)"
    Last time to use

.BI "\-dt" " <real> (0)"
    Only write out frame when t MOD dt = offset

.BI "\-offset" " <real> (0)"
    Time offset for \fB\-dt\fR option

.BI "\-[no]settime" "  (no)"
    Change starting time interactively

.BI "\-[no]sort" "  (yes)"
    Sort energy files (not frames)

.BI "\-[no]rmdh" "  (no)"
    Remove free energy block data

.BI "\-scalefac" " <real> (1)"
    Multiply energy component by this factor

.BI "\-[no]error" "  (yes)"
    Stop on errors in the file


.SH KNOWN ISSUES


\- When combining trajectories the sigma and E2 (necessary for statistics) are not updated correctly. Only the actual energy is correct. One thus has to compute statistics in another way.
