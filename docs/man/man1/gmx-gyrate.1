.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgmx gyrate\fR computes the radius of gyration of a molecule and the radii of gyration about the \fIx\fR\-, \fIy\fR\- and \fIz\fR\-axes, as a function of time. The atoms are explicitly mass weighted.

With the \fB\-nmol\fR option the radius of gyration will be calculated for multiple molecules by splitting the analysis group in equally sized parts.

With the option \fB\-nz\fR 2D radii of gyration in the \fIx\-y\fR plane of slices along the \fIz\fR\-axis are calculated.
