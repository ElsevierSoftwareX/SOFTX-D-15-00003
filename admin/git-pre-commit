# This script is intended as a pre-commit hook that optionally runs all
# changes through some formatting check.  Currently, it runs uncrustify and
# checks copyright headers.
#
# By default, it does nothing.  To enable the script after copying it to
# .git/hooks/pre-commit, you need to set
#   git config hooks.uncrustifymode check
#   git config hooks.uncrustifypath /path/to/uncrustify
# With this configuration, all source files modified in the commit are run
# through uncrustify and checked for correct copyright headers
# (see admin/uncrustify.sh for how this set of files is determined).
# If any file is changed by uncrustify or has other problems, the names of
# those files are reported and the commit is prevented.  The issues can be
# fixed by running admin/uncrustify.sh manually.
#
# To disable the hook, you can set
#   git config hooks.uncrustifymode off
# To disable it temporarily for a commit, set NO_FORMAT_CHECK environment
# variable.  For example,
#   NO_FORMAT_CHECK=1 git commit -a
# You can also run git commit --no-verify, but that also disables other hooks,
# such as the Change-Id hook used by gerrit.
#
# The actual work is done by the admin/uncrustify.sh script, which gets
# run with the 'check-index' action.
# See the comments in that script for more information.
